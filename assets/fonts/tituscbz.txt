In cooperation with BITSTREAM, the TITUS project has prepared a Unicode Font (in Windows TTF format) 
to match the requirements of linguists and philologists working on several languages (ancient and modern). 
This font (named "TITUS Cyberbit Basic"), now compliant with UNICODE 4.0 , is available for non-commercial users only. 
The font can be downloaded here http://titus.fkidg1.uni-frankfurt.de/unicode/tituut.asp
(N.B. the preparation of the download file may take a minute). 
If you want to use the font with your web browser, you will have to configure your system and your browser in the way indicated above.

On the basis of the tool "Uniqoder" developed by Östen Dahl, Andrej Perdih created UniqTitus, a UNICODE keyboard layout for MS Word. This tool, which is available for non-commercial users only, can be downloaded here. http://titus.fkidg1.uni-frankfurt.de/unicode/tituut.asp
